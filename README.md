# Fake News Detector 🔍📰

## 🧠 Objective
Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that detects whether an article headline or content is fake or real.

## 📦 Dataset
We'll be using a labeled dataset of real vs. fake news articles to train a classifier.

## 🔧 ML Workflow
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering (e.g., TF-IDF, NLP techniques)
- Model Selection & Evaluation (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Final Pipeline using Scikit-learn
- Deploy to a Web App (Flask or Streamlit)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy / Matplotlib
- NLP tools (e.g., NLTK or spaCy)
- Streamlit (for app deployment)
